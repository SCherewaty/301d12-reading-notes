What is a server, and how is it different from a regular computer? How would you describe this difference to a friend who doesnâ€™t know much about computers?

A regular computer is like a friendly robot you see at a tech fair that chats with you and dances.  A server is like an industrial robot; nuthin' but business and zero social skills.
