Readings: VPC
Below you will find reading material and additional resources that support today’s topic and the upcoming lecture.

How can one host within a VPC any services that need to be public?
VPCs utilize dedicated subnets and Virtual Local Area Networks, only accessible by the VPC customer, which prevents others within the public cloud from gaining access to computing resources inside the VPC – essentially putting "dibs" on the VPC. 
What are examples of services that would live in the publicly-accessible part of the VPC? The privately-accessible part?
Cloudflare host inside of AWS for example.

What are the trade-offs of using a VPC vs traditional infrastructure?
Speed of service vs security.
