Computer Network - AAA (Authentication, Authorization and Accounting)

Explain each of the three A’s as you would to a non-technical family member. Use an analogy or a story.
Authentication - The "bouncer" at the club checking ID's to see if you are who you say you are.  It's the first step to gaining access to a system.

Authorization - The bouncer then relays to the next person inside the club (the "authorizer") who you are and what you're allowed to do. 

Accounting - Accounting asks as an overseer to the club, observing people and the actions they take.


What should the administrator do if the ACS server fails to authenticate a user during AAA implementation?
"Note – If the ACS server fails to authenticate, the administrator should mention using the local database of the device as a backup, in the method list, to implement AAA."

What is the role of the NAS in the AAA implementation using an ACS server? Use a diagram.
"The Network Access Server (NAS) sends authentication requests to the ACS server and the server takes the decision to allow the user to access the network resource or not according to the credentials provided by the user."

RADIUS Concepts

What are the benefits of using RADIUS for authentication and authorization?
Better security, improved customer tracking (for billing), better granualization of metrics.

What is RADIUS and what does it stand for?
Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service

Research: What encryption algorithms does RADIUS use?
Radius uses MD5 encryption.
