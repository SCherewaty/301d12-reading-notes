Explain the role of a Domain Controller?
A domain controller manages groups of individual PC's, networks of PC's, or groups of servers both local and/or remote.

What is the benefit of being able to login with the same username and password on any computer joined to the domain? What are the security risks?

Describe how group policies are used in domains?
A single entity deploys a single update that updates all computers on the network through the domain controller.

In what other ways can you think of that domains could be used beyond what was presented in the reading?
