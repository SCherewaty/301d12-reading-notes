What is a port? Describe it with an analogy that would help a family member understand.
It's a program that monitors filtered, open or closed statuses in regard to ports within a network. 

What does a port scanner send to a port to check the current status?
It sends a request.

When a port scanner sends a request to connect, what are the three possible responses? Describe them.
"Open, Aceepted" - a server is responding and willing to serve the host.
"Closed, Not Listening" - The port may be closed or in use and doesn't know anyone is requesting.
"Filtered, Dropped or Blocked" - No response, silence.

What is the difference between TCP and UDP?
-TCP is a fast request scan that utilizes the SYN, ACK handshake to find and route packets to destinations.
-UDP is slower and generally needs a more definite target.
