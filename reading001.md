Layers of OSI Model
What does “OSI” stand for?
Open Systems Interconnection.

List the 7 layers of the OSI model and what each one is responsible for.
Application Layer - Essentially user interface of the connection.
Presentation Layer - Extracted information and formatted to transport.
Session Layer - Establishes connection, maintains sessions and provides authentication.
Transport Layer - Takes services from the Network Layer and provides services to the application Layer.
Network layer - This is the sender and receiver layer between hosts.
Datalink Layer - where each node will deliver a "package" of information from one to another.
Physical Layer - Physical interface between devices or connections
Distinguish which layers are the “hardware layers”, and which layers are the “software layers”. What does that even mean?

How can the OSI model be used in troubleshooting?
Readily identify which layer an issue may be happening and isolate it.

What Is Wireshark and How Is It Used?
Feel free to stop at “How to Use Wireshark”
What is Wireshark?
It's a network packet capture tool.

What is a packet?
A packet is a grouping of data being sent along a network.

What 3 high-level things does Wireshark accomplish? How could these be used for nefarious purposes? For benevolent purposes?
Capturing packets - intercepting packets with the intent to extort - capturing malware packets before creating victims.
Visualizing - can be used to spy on data streams - could be used in sting operations.
filtration - easier for hackers to find what they want - easier to recon the info targeted by hackers.
